# Interactive example `min-height`

To illustrate the `min-height` property, I will show a parent block-shaped div and a child block-shaped div within the parent. The user will be able to turn a minimum height of the parent div on or off, and the height formatting of the div will be echoed back to the user. The user will use a slider to adjust the height of the child div, which has no minimum height.

When a minimum height is not set on the parent, it will adjust height automatically to accommodate the size of the child. When a minimum height is set, however, the parent will always exhibit the minimum height regardless of the size of the child. The parent could grow larger than the minimum height, of course.
