# Interactive example `<sup>`

To illustrate the effect of the `sup` tag, I display a normal, unformatted sentence and show checkboxes that control the visibility of superscript and subscript around the normal text. This will help to highlight the differences between the superscript/subscript and plain, unformatted text.

I'd also like to show the HTML code of the displayed text within the tool, to help the user see the tags in action.
