# The `sup` Tag

In HTML, the `sup` tag is used to render superscript text.

Characters formatted as superscript are generally half the height of standard characters and appear slightly above the normal line of type. Superscript is commonly used to render footnotes and mathematical exponents.

Here's an example of superscript text alongside normally formatted characters:
<pre>Here is the normal line of type <sup>And here is some superscript</pre>

## Syntax

To format text as superscript, wrap it in the `sup tags`:

```
        ...
```
